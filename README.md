# Depth in convolutional neural networks solves scene segmentation

Code (and data) for Seijdel, N., Tsakmakidis, N., de Haan, E.H.F., Bohte, S.M. & Scholte, H. S. (2019, July). Deeper convolutional neural networks perform implicit scene segmentation.

Notebook 1 follows the analysis steps of experiment 1  
Notebook 2 generates the stimuli + results for experiment 2: training ResNets on segmented vs. unsegmented stimuli.
